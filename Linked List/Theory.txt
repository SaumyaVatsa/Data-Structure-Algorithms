- Linked List is a similar data structure like Array but it stores data in non-contigous location. 
- The size of the linked list is not fixed it can be increased or decreased as per the requirements. 

The first element of linked list is called Head. It contains the address of the second element and similarly the second will have the address
the third element. The last element of the linked list is called Tail. 

In summary, each element of the linked list contains the address of the element coming after it. 

Uses:- 
1. Linked list can be used in implementing stack/queue data structures. 
2. In real life, it's used in browser. 

To create an element for linked list we need to define a self-define data type using Struct in C++.
